"You believe that Christmas is a horrible holiday inspired by nothing more than capitalistic greed. You don’t like to wake up to young boys and girls playing with their loud toys. You hate the noise of it all the most. You dislike the feasts people have and their get-togethers. You hate caroling and the songs sung at Christmas time. If you could stop Christmas from happening, you would."
